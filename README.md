# IEEE-Bilkent-Robotics-and-Automation-Lectures
All materials in this repository are prepared by Oguz Altan.

This repository contains resources for the four weeks long Introduction to Arduino and Fundamentals of Eletronics course that I have given voluntarily and free of charge to around 100 students in the semester 2018-2019. As the coordinator of the Robotics & Automation Society of IEEE Bilkent Student Branch, I have given various courses on electronics and computer science to university students. 
## Course Content
The main project of these lectures is to develop a Remote Controlled Car with a Bluetooth connection. Course starts with fundamentals of Arduino programming, fundamental characteristics of Arduino, digital vs analog electronics, I/O interface and breadboard prototyping. Next session focuses on DC motor control with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Arduino scripting. Third session teaches about understanding Bluetooth technology, telecommunication tehcniques and using HC06 Bluetooth module.In the fourth and last session, students completed their remote cars and were able to control them using their smartphones via Bluetooth.
